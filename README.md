# MXML 2 LUA
A tool for converting MXML files - the No Man's Sky game data file format, generated by [MBINCompiler](https://github.com/monkeyman192/MBINCompiler "MBINCompiler") - to a lua table and back.
The tool handles full files or specific sections. It can load the data to memory directly or write it to a text file as a ready-to-use lua script.
## mxml-as-lua table format
Every section in its own table, and each section has a `meta` table containing the attributes of the mxml class or list.
Using these rules, the following describes a string class section:
```lua
{
    meta = {name='ZoomLevels', value='GcZoomData'},
    ZoomType = 'Mid',
    EffectStrength = 1.0,
    MoveSpeed = 10.0,
    FoV = 40.0,
    MinScanDistance = 5.0,
    MaxScanDistance = 70.0
}
```
An ordered list of values just stores them in order:
```lua
{
    meta = {name='LodDistances'},
    0,
    50,
    80,
    150,
    500
}
```
An ordered list of named values stored each key-and-value in a separate table:
```lua
{
    meta = {name='Reward', value='GcRewardSalvageShip'},
    GcRewardSalvageShip = {
        meta = {name='GcRewardSalvageShip'},
        RewardShipParts = true,
        SpecificCustomisationSlotIDs = {
            meta = {name='SpecificCustomisationSlotIDs'},
            {Freighter = ''},
            {Dropship = 'DROPSHIP_WINGS'},
            {Fighter = 'FIGHTER_WINGS'},
            {Scientific = 'SCI_L_WING'},
            {Shuttle = 'SHUTTLE_WING'},
            {PlayerFreighter = ''},
            {Royal = ''},
            {Alien = ''},
            {Sail = 'SAIL_WINGS'},
            {Robot = ''}
        }
    }
}
```
This format can describe any MXML data.
